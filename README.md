Coming along my journey as a beginning web developer, my experience has been hectic to say the least. Getting the basics of HTML down is something that has just really clicked for me. Now that I've gotten down HTML (for the most part), I'm still trying the grasp how to properly apply the styles.css to my code. Along with everything, javascript has really given me a run for my money. Initially, javascript made me question becoming a software engineer all together. Until I realized the concept of web development itself isn't really hard,it's only hard if you don't put in extra time outside of class like we have been instructed to do since day one.

I would love to put in 20+ hours a week outside of class to study but with this cohort being 10-2:30 P.M. and work from 5-3:30 am Monday-Friday, it's much harder to dedicate the time I want to studies.

I had to reference several websites and YouTube videos to simply start
one being "Code Explained 'Multiple Choice Quiz Using Javascript'"
Though I didn't copy the code verbatim I used a good bit of the code for a guideline.

For the index.html document I referenced and structured my quiz mimicking an 'array' of different codes.

In using this assignment the user must be able to click a functioning 'start' button and then user is presented with a question and timer. Once the user clicks on the question, they're then prompted to another question. If the question is answered correctly user receives a "green"alert. Alternatively, if the answer is incorrect the user will receive a "red" alert. Once the game is over, user should be alerted with score and should be able to save they're initials; (If I installed that properly). The javascript should be inserted with the quiz.js file I created which I learned from one of the YouTube videos linked below.
